## About
This repository contains the submission requirements for the EE5907/EE5027 Programming Assignment CA1 task.

## Requirements
The codes are written in **Python 3.6.10** and in **Jupyter Notebook**.

The main packages used are **scipy**, **pandas**, **numpy** and **matplotlib**. 

While technically all versions should work, if you do not have the packages installed or if errors arise, please create a new virtual environment with the above Python version and install the exact required packages using the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Code
To run the code, simply start up Jupyter Notebook in your terminal.
E.g. After entering the Python environment, type `jupyter-notebook`

Open the "ee5907_ca1.ipynb" file from the Jupyter console and the codes should appear.

Please note that the dataset should be saved as per the original format as per "spamData.mat" and placed in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook ipynb script.
Alternatively, you may edit the script if you wish to direct the `loadmat()` function to read the address from another location where you saved the dataset.
